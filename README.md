## Programming Paradigms
Some of the challenges for the **Programming Paradigms** course, which dealt with the **Logical Paradigm** _(using **Prolog**)_ and the **Functional Paradigm** _(using **Haskell**)_. Most of the Challenges are made in **Prolog**, the **Haskell** ones are *very* scarce since that area came at the end of the course.

Also, I did a small [presentation](https://github.com/zubie7a/Programming_Paradigms/raw/master/Common_Lisp_Slides.pdf) on a functional language I like, which is **LISP**.

This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
