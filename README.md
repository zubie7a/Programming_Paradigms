##Programming Paradigms Challenges
Challenges for the (optional) Programming Paradigms course, which dealt with the *Logical Paradigm* (using **Prolog**) and the *Functional Paradigm* (using **Haskell**). Most of the Challenges are made in **Prolog**, the **Haskell** ones are *very* scarce. Also, did a small [presentation](https://github.com/Zubieta/Programming_Paradigms/raw/master/Common_Lisp_Slides.pdf) on a functional language I like, which is **LISP**. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.
