##Programming Paradigms Challenges
Challenges for the Programming Paradigms course, which dealt with the Logical Paradigm (using Prolog) and the Functional Paradigm (using Haskell). Most of the Challenges are made in Prolog, the Haskell ones are scarce. Also, did a small presentation on a Functional Language I like, which is LISP.
